    <h1>What I did over winter break</h1>
    <p>During my winter break, I enjoyed spending time with my family and friends. </p>
    <p>I also did these things</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I slept in till the afternoon and watched a bunch of shows I was planning to watch</li>
    <li>I hung out with friends and family and celebrated my friends 18th and my fathers 57th</li>
    <li>I ate a huge amount of food during these events and drank 16 year old ice cider wine from canada</li>
    <li>I spent a crazy amount of money on clothes and im still waiting for them to come</li>
    <li>I got new glasses which finally fit my eyes</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Some text with a <span id="highlight">special phrase</span>then more text </p>

    <p>I did also do alot of other things during the break but I am honestly way to lazy to write about them</p>

    <h4>I overall enjoyed winter break and it gave me a little expereince of how it feels to graduate.</h4>
